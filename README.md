# HIP - Hamed's Image Processing Library

## V1.0.1: December 2017

## Overview

HIP contains basic image processing functionality, including *load*, *imshow*, *saveas*, and *color conversion*.

HIP also supports *image resizing*, *rotation*, *cropping*, *edge detection*, *gradient magnitude*, *affine transforms* and adding different types of noise. These basic operations are used broadly in many image processing and computer vision pre-processing applications. I prefer to have my own functions, rather that using some standard python libraries :)

## Tutorial

Tutorial will be added here soon.
